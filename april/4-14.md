For my friends who are curious: yes I am back in the States. I spent the last 18 days under strict quarantine in Shanghai, of which you might have seen my pictures. My last 72 hours in Shanghai were a once in a lifetime experience, filled with lockdown, food shortage, social media riot, self-organized covid tests, sharing the last beer with fellow quarantined folks, finding someone "with connections" to get a pass, crossing the city of silence at 4am in the backseat of a van, passing through police checkpoints in a don't-ask-don't-tell way, helping a lady who got stranded at the airport for 2 days without food, and finally, a regular United Airline sleep over the pacific. Hello SFO. On Monday, 45 minutes after I took off from Shanghai Pudong Airport, the US consulate in Shanghai ordered all its staff and families to evacuate back to the States. If you are interested in hearing more, I am available for beer. Christopher - the pictures are real but I intended to use them as baits :)
